This a webpage that lets find repos for a username and then search through them by the title. It is from a <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/svelte-javascript-framework-introduction/">tutorial on sitepoint by Jack franklin. After hearing Scott Tolinski going on about it, I had to check it out and I am pleasantly surpised by it. I really dig the single file for pages/components isolating the css, html, and JavaScript from other pages/components. I'm sure I'll be writing some more webpages in Svelte :smiley:
